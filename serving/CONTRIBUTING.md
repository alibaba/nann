# Contributing guidelines

## How to become a contributor and submit your own code

### Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your patches! Before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html).
  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work, then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html).

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll be able to accept your pull requests.

***NOTE***: Only original source code from you and other people that have signed the CLA can be accepted into the main repository.

### Contributing code

If you have improvements to TensorFlow Serving, send us your pull requests!
For those just getting started, Github has a [howto](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

If you want to contribute but you're not sure where to start, take a look at the
[issues with the "contributions welcome" label](https://github.com/tensorflow/serving/labels/contributions%20welcome).
These are issues that we believe are particularly well suited for outside
contributions, often because we probably won't get to them right now. If you
decide to start on an issue, leave a comment so that other people know that
you're working on it. If you want to help out, but not alone, use the issue
comment thread to coordinate.
