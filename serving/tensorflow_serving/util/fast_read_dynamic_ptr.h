// FastReadDynamicPtr<> is a thread-safe class used to manage an object that
// needs to be updated occasionally while being accessed from multiple threads.
//
// Typical use requires construction of a new object while the old object is
// still being used, calling Update() when the new object is ready.  Access to
// the object is asynchronous relative to update operations, so pointers may
// exist to both the old and the new object at the same time (although there can
// never be more than two objects concurrently). After the update begins, any
// new calls to get() will point to the new object. The update will then block
// until all pointers to the old object go out of scope.  This is achieved via a
// reference counted smart pointer.
//
// This class is functionally very similar to using a shared_ptr guarded by a
// mutex, with the important distinction that it provides finer control over
// which thread destroys the object, the number of live objects, the ability to
// recycle old objects if desired, and it forces an efficient pattern for
// updating data (swapping in a pointer rather than in-place modification).
//
// Example Use:
//
//  In initialization code:
//    FastReadDynamicPtr<HeavyWeightObject> ptr{InitialValue()};
//
//  From updating thread (executes infrequently, not performance sensitive):
//    std::unique_ptr<HeavyWeightObject> new_object(LongRunningFunction());
//    std::unique_ptr<HeavyWeightObject> old_object =
//        ptr.Update(std::move(new_object));
//    // Reuse old_object, or just destroy it.
//
//  From reading thread (executes frequently, high performance requirements):
//    auto object = ptr.get();
//    if (object != nullptr) {
//      HandleRequest(object.get());
//    }
//
// Care must be taken to not call FastReadDynamicPtr::Update() from a thread
// that owns any instances of FastReadDynamicPtr::ReadPtr, or else deadlock may
// occur.
